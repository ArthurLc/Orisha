# UnityMeshSimplifier
Mesh simplification for [Unity](https://unity3d.com/). The project is deeply based on the [Fast Quadric Mesh Simplification](https://github.com/sp4cerat/Fast-Quadric-Mesh-Simplification) algorithm, but rewritten entirely in C# and released under the MIT license.

## Compatibility
These scripts have been tested and confirmed working with Unity 5.6.0f3, Unity 2017.1.0f3, Unity 2017.2.1f1 and Unity 2017.3.0f3.

## Installation into Unity project
1. Copy the contents of this repository into a folder named *UnityMeshSimplifier* in your Assets directory within your Unity project.
2. Done!

## How do I use this?
```c#
float quality = 0.5f;
var meshSimplifier = new UnityMeshSimplifier.MeshSimplifier();
meshSimplifier.Initialize(sourceMesh);
meshSimplifier.SimplifyMesh(quality);
var destMesh = meshSimplifier.ToMesh();
```

or

```c#
float quality = 0.5f;
var meshSimplifier = new UnityMeshSimplifier.MeshSimplifier();
meshSimplifier.Vertices = vertices;
meshSimplifier.AddSubMeshTriangles(indices);
meshSimplifier.SimplifyMesh(quality);
var newVertices = meshSimplifier.Vertices;
var newIndices = meshSimplifier.GetSubMeshTriangles(0);
```
